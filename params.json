{"name":"Simplicity for Lightroom","tagline":"Lightroom plug-in to create a simple and stylish portfolio website","body":"Simplicity for Lightroom\r\n========================\r\n\r\nSimplicity is a web gallery plug-in for Adobe Lightroom.  It allows you to quickly create a simple porfolio website from a collection of images.\r\n\r\nSee [http://www.andrewbriggsphotography.co.uk/simplicity/](http://www.andrewbriggsphotography.co.uk/simplicity/) for a demo.\r\n\r\nPlease [drop me an email](mailto:andrew@brggs.co.uk) if you have any comments or feedback.\r\n\r\n###Features\r\n- Thumbnail view, with pop-up full view showing the image title\r\n- Social links\r\n- Allows filtering the view by tag\r\n- Lazy loading of images when they scroll into view\r\n\r\n###Installation\r\n1. Download the plug-in using the link to the left\r\n1. Extract the files from the zip\r\n1. Copy the simplicity-gallery-v1.lrwebengine folder to your the Lightroom folder within your user profile.  For example: C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Lightroom\\Web Galleries\\\r\n1. Run Lightroom, then go to the Web module.  Simplicity Gallery should be displayed as an option in the menu in the top left corner.\r\n\r\n###Usage Notes\r\n- **The preview doesn't work properly as Lightroom seems to have a rather out of date browser.**  Don't worry, the end result will look fine.\r\n- For a title to be shown in the full view, it must be set in the metadata for the image.  This can be done in the Library module.\r\n\r\n###Credits\r\nSimplicity for Lightroom makes use of the following:\r\n\r\n- [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/)\r\n- [SocIcon](http://www.socicon.com/)\r\n- [FancyBox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/)\r\n- Title photo from https://www.flickr.com/photos/wwworks/6138546433/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
