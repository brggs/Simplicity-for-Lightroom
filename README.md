Simplicity for Lightroom
========================

Simplicity is a web gallery plug-in for Adobe Lightroom.  It allows you to quickly create a simple porfolio website from a collection of images.

See [http://www.andrewbriggsphotography.co.uk/simplicity/](http://www.andrewbriggsphotography.co.uk/simplicity/) for a demo.

Note this was developed for version 5 of Lightroom, and as such may not be compatible with later versions.

Please [drop me an email](mailto:andrew@brggs.co.uk) if you have any comments or feedback.

###Features
- Thumbnail view, with pop-up full view showing the image title
- Social links
- Allows filtering the view by tag
- Lazy loading of images when they scroll into view

###Installation
1. Download the plug-in.
1. Extract the files from the zip
1. Copy the simplicity-gallery-v1.lrwebengine folder to your the Lightroom folder within your user profile.  For example: C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Lightroom\Web Galleries\
1. Run Lightroom, then go to the Web module.  Simplicity Gallery should be displayed as an option in the menu in the top right corner.

###Usage Notes
- **The preview doesn't work properly as Lightroom seems to have a rather out of date browser.**  Don't worry, the end result will look fine.
- For a title to be shown in the full view, it must be set in the metadata for the image.  This can be done in the Library module.
